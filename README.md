# Magic Pong

## Description
Magic Pong is a modern take on the classic game of Pong. Built with pure Vanilla JavaScript, Magic Pong is a game that you can start as soon as your browser loads. Users play against a Computer (a.k.a the left paddle) in which whoever reaches 11 points first wins the game.  The game ends with either a win or lose message and instructs the user to refresh their browser to start a new game.
